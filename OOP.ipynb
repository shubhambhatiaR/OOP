        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
        " - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which contain data (attributes) and methods (functions). It uses key principles like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction to organize and structure code for better reusability, scalability, and maintainability\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP\n",
        " - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "  - For example, a Car class might have attributes like color and speed, and methods like drive() and brake().\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. What is an object in OOP\n",
        "   - An object in OOP is an instance of a class. It contains real values for the attributes and can use the methods defined in the class. Objects represent real-world entities in a program.\n",
        "\n",
        "   4.  What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation\n",
        "    - Abstraction hides unnecessary details and shows only the essential features.\n",
        "    - Encapsulation hides the internal data and allows access through methods\n",
        "\n",
        "  5.  What are dunder methods in Python\n",
        " - Dunder methods in Python (short for “double underscore” methods) are special methods with names that start and end with double underscores, like __init__, __str__, and __len__. They are used to define the behavior of objects with built-in functions and operators.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        " - Inheritance in OOP is a concept where a child class (or subclass) inherits attributes and methods from a parent class (or superclass). It allows code reusability and helps create a hierarchical relationship between classes\n",
        "\n",
        " 7. What is polymorphism in OOP\n",
        "  - Polymorphism in OOP means the ability of different objects to respond to the same method in different ways. It allows one interface to be used for different data types or classes\n",
        "\n",
        "  8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python\n",
        "   - Encapsulation in Python is achieved by using access modifiers:\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  Prefixing attributes with a single underscore _ (protected) or double underscore __ (private)\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  Accessing data through getter and setter methods to control access.\n",
        "\n",
        "  9.  What is a constructor in Python\n",
        "   - A constructor in Python is the __init__() method that initializes a new object when it is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python\n",
        " - Class methods take cls as the first parameter and can access or modify the class state.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Static methods don’t take self or cls and act like regular functions inside a class.\n",
        "\n",
        " 11.  What is method overloading in Python\n",
        "  - Python does not support traditional method overloading (multiple methods with the same name but different parameters). Instead, you can achieve similar behavior by using default arguments or handling different parameter types inside a single method.\n",
        "\n",
        "  12. What is method overriding in OOP\n",
        "   - Method overriding is when a subclass provides its own version of a method already defined in its parent class to change or extend its behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "   13. What is a property decorator in Python\n",
        "    - The @property decorator in Python allows you to define a method that can be accessed like an attribute, enabling controlled access to private variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "    14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP\n",
        "   - Polymorphism is important because it allows different objects to be treated through a common interface, making code more flexible and easier to extend.\n",
        "\n",
        "   15. What is an abstract class in Python\n",
        "    - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated and usually contains one or more abstract methods that must be implemented by its subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "  16.  What are the advantages of OOP\n",
        "     - Advantages of OOP:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Modularity: Code is organized into objects.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Reusability: Classes can be reused through inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Scalability: Easier to manage large programs.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Maintainability: Easier to update and debug.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Encapsulation: Protects data by hiding details.\n",
        "\n",
        " 17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable\n",
        "  - Class variable is shared by all instances of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Instance variable is unique to each object (instance) of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        " 18. What is multiple inheritance in Python\n",
        "  - Multiple inheritance in Python is when a class inherits from more than one parent class, gaining attributes and methods from all of them.\n",
        "\n",
        "  19.  Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   - __str__: Returns a user-friendly string representation of an object (used by print()).\n",
        "\n",
        " - __repr__: Returns an official string representation meant for developers, useful for debugging (should ideally be unambiguous).\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python\n",
        " - The super() function lets a subclass call methods from its parent class, enabling reuse of parent behavior and supporting proper inheritance, especially in multiple inheritance scenarios\n",
        "\n",
        " 21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python\n",
        "  - The __del__ method in Python is a destructor that is called when an object is about to be destroyed, used to clean up resources like closing files or releasing memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "  22.  What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python\n",
        "   - @staticmethod: Defines a method that doesn’t access the class or instance; behaves like a regular function inside a class.\n",
        "   - @classmethod: Defines a method that takes the class (cls) as the first argument and can access or modify class state.\n",
        "\n",
        "   23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance\n",
        "    - In Python, polymorphism with inheritance lets a subclass override a parent class method, so when you call that method on different objects, each responds in its own way. This allows the same method call to work differently depending on the object’s class.\n",
        "\n",
        "    24. What is method chaining in Python OOP\n",
        "     - Method chaining in Python OOP is calling multiple methods on the same object in a single statement, where each method returns the object itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "     25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "      - The __call__ method allows an object to be called like a function. When defined, you can use obj() syntax to execute custom behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
